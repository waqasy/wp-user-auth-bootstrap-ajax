# wp-user-auth-bootstrap
Personal Plugin for allowing users to register into your WordPress site. Still in the work.

Currently I have shortcodes for registration and login forms. [register-form], [login-form].

NOTE: This is not meant to be distributed since it only suits to my use cases, however you can use it at your own risk if you wish to. It assumes you're using bootstrap and font-awesome, of course you can add your own design.  

Registration form:

![register](register-form.png)

Login form:

![login](login-form.png)
